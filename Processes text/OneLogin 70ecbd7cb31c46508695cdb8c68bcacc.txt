OneLogin
OneLogin is our Single Sign On tool used to manage all of our core accounts and the majority of others. 
The user accounts are automatically created when the work email is populated in Bamboo and the sync runs every 6 hours, however it is possible to force an earlier sync by following the steps below: 
	1.	Log into OneLoginâ€™s admin portal 
	2.	Select Users > Directories 
	3.	Click on Bamboo
	4.	Select more actions
	5.	Lastly choose synchronise users 

You can monitor the progress by viewing jobs under the activity tabs

Please note: Even when running these manual syncs the users department, division etc will not populate until their effective date noted in Bamboo.
