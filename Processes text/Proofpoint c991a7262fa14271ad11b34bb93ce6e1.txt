Proofpoint
Proofpoint is our email filtering platform which scans incoming email to our domains (motorway-it.co.uk, motorway.co.uk and motorway.com) before passing onto Google to deliver to the end user. 
There is no directory sync with Google so accounts have to be created at the time of onboarding and deleted at the point of the 4 week clean-up when the mailbox itself is also deleted. Please see sections below for logging in, adding, and deleting a user from the system. 
Logging in.
This is the URL for Proofpoint: https://eu1.proofpointessentials.com/app/login.php
Log in with your motorway.co.uk email address and password. 
2FA is required for all admin accounts, and if you are unable to log-in due to no mobile number on your account, please let another member of the team know who does have access and can populate your mobile number into your account. 

Adding a User
Once you are logged in, please look at the Administration Section → Expand User Management and select “Users”. 
￼
Click Add USER and you will be taken to a new page to create the account. Please populate the details like first name / last name / email address. 
When doing email address - please make sure that ‘@motorway.co.uk’ is selected.

NOTE: If the user is in a London based team, manager and above of their department or has a specific use case, then you will need to allow the user to release their own emails from quarantine. 
Go to the Spam tab, then change release policy to “User can release” then Press SAVE.
