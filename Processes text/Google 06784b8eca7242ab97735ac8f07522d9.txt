A key application in this list is Google, please follow the steps below to ensure their Google account is setup correctly:
	1.	In OneLogin go to applications on the profile and check the account is listed as provisioned. 
	2.	In Google admin search for the account to ensure the provision was successful.
	3.	Check their OU is set to Motorway Staff / Outsourced agents.
	4.	Check they have been added to the group “WNS Office.”
	5.	Check their job title has been set to match the one you have outlined in OneLogin.
