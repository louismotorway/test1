WNS setup guide
💡
Please note that unlike standard accounts we set up WNS accounts with the email format firstname.lastname@motorway.co.uk
When a WNS onboarding ticket comes in, please apply the WNS Onboarding w/Tasks Template to populate the tasks required for the setup. 

	1.	Using the list of names you have been provided fill out the CSV file with the details for their account, ensuring that you add the office location and division, these will be taken into affect when setting up accounts in linked applications like Google. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gUJtFhYUbZwvdZjmW2HWiaEBMDOu5_zT00ASemIKWio/edit#gid=1838748532
